MedX is a platform for easy stoage and access of electronic medical records(EMR) that would revolutionise the current health care services globally.It uses the ethereum block chain to record patient's medical information.It grants the user complete control over his/her own medical records and allows to make certain aspects public or private, while still being stored in a distributed global manner.The product will be life-saving in medical emergencies as the medical records of a user can be accessed whenever and wherever required and will quicken the process of treatment.

Whenever a new user joins the block chain or a user shares his/her medical record with a doctor for consulation,he/she pays a certain fee(ether) to the miners approving the transaction.
